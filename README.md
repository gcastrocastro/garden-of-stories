# Technologies Used:
Express, MongoDB, Node.js, Mongoose, and Google Authorization

# Getting Started:

https://safe-castle-74268.herokuapp.com/

When the site loads, the user will land on our homepage and see our greeting message.
If a user is not logged in they will only have access to the All Books index, along with the reviews attached to each individual book. They will not be able to leave a review until they log in with Google Authorization.

# Next Steps:
- Improve colorstory in book show view
- Expand on filter options 
- Add a shopping link option for users
